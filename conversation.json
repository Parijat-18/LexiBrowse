        "lexi": "Deep RL refers to the use of deep neural networks in reinforcement learning, which is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. Deep RL can be used to finetune LLMs (Language Model Models) by training the model to generate more accurate and context-aware responses based on the feedback it receives from the environment. However, building policies of high-quality is challenging when the feature space of states is small and the training data is limited. To address this challenge, Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FedRL) has been proposed as a novel framework to build models of high-quality for agents with consideration of their privacies. FedRL aims to learn a private Q-network policy for each agent by sharing limited information (i.e., output of the Q-network) among agents while protecting the privacy of data and models."
