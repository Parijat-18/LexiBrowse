        "lexi": "Deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) is a type of machine learning that combines deep neural networks with reinforcement learning algorithms to enable agents to learn from their environment through trial and error. It can be used for fine-tuning LLM (likely loss of market) by building policies of high-quality for agents with consideration of their privacies, as proposed in the Federated deep Reinforcement Learning (FedRL) framework. However, directly transferring data or models from an agent to another agent is often not allowed due to the privacy of data and/or models in many privacy-aware applications. To protect the privacy of data and models, Gaussian differentials are exploited on the information shared with each other when updating their local models."
